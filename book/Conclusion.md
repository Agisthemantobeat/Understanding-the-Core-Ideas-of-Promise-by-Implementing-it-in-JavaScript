# Conclusion

The main purpose of this tutorial was to walk through the core concepts of promise and see the background of the ideas with an *evolutionary vision*.

Sometimes deep diving into a concept is not enough to completely understand it.

Sometimes we need to go back to before the big bang and see the WHY, then we can evolve with it.

As here we started with nothing about the new world of promise, and suddenly the first step was taken by the explosion of the first idea. Afterward we immersed our mind in the evolution of this new world and grow with each other.
